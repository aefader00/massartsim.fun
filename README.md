**MASSARTSIM.FUN**
This is a student-run website for everyone in the Studio of Interrelated Media department at Massachusetts College of Art and Design!

Remote learning has really, really sucked. This app hopes to make it suck less, by offering some utilities for students that will hopefully makes the quarantine a little more tolerable.

**Thursday Activities**
With this tool, you can browse through every scheduled activity in the semester.

You get to see a description of each activity, what time they're at, who's producing them, and what faculty will be hosting them. Clicking on the activities will redirect you to where they're meeting, which is usually on Zoom.

If you want to produce an activity, you can click the button at the top of the page to be given the activity proposal form, with which you can, well, propose your activity.

The faculty will then look over your proposal, and if it gets approved it'll be added to the schedule!

**Collaboration Map**
With this tool, you can check a map and see what students or faculty are near you, so you can meet up with them and collaborate in person. Just remember to wear a mask and socially distance!

Everyone marked on this map has volunteered to be on it. If you'd like to be on the map, contact Anthony Fader at aefader@massart.edu and he will add you as soon as he can.

**Discord Server**
This will redirect you to the student-run Studio for Interrelated Media Discord Server! There, you'll be able to hang out with your friends talk about your day, school, and whatever else you want to.

Discord is an instant messaging platform that's basically just Slack but better. It's completely free, you can run it entirely within your browser, and you don't need to make an account before entering servers. Just click on the link, and say hello!
